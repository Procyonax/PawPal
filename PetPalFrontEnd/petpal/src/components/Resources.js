        When a dog is in distress, we care for them. When a dog needs a home, we
        find them a loving family. When an owner needs a helping hand (or paw)
        or they just can`t cope, we`re ready to step in.{" "}

        At Battersea, we take in every animal who needs us. We give each one
        lots of love and expert care and get to know their characters and quirks
        so we can find them a new home that`s just right for them.
