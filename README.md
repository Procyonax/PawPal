## Brief

A Java application built on a Spring framework with a PostgreSQL database and a Javascript/React frontend which will allow the user to find a suitable dog breed for adoption based on criteria that is tailored to the users lifestyle/environment.

## MVP

- The user will be able to answer a set of questions on the type of dog they would like.
- The application will be able to provide useful links to organisations to access further information as well as to adoption resources.
- The application will make use of an api or multiple to retrieve information on breeds and add this to a database.
- The application will return results based on the users input.
- The application will suggest a suitable dog breed based on the input.

## Extensions

- Allow the user to create a profile for their dog.
- Allow the user input information to track the exercise and health of their dog.
